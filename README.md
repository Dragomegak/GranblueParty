Frontend and Backend source code of [granblue.party](https://www.granblue.party) website.

## Disclaimer
The last website I did before this one was 15 years ago. I do this for fun in my spare time. The languages and softwares I chose might not be the best for the job. I only chose them to learn something new. Some of the code is probably horrible. Feel free to submit modifications and bugfixes if you feel like it. I'll do my best to integrate them if I agree with the changes.

## Usage
Each folder contains its own `README.md` file. You should read them in this order:

1. WikiParser
2. API
3. Frontend
